# Tauron outages

Git scraping outages from Tauron.

[More details](https://www.kubawolanin.com/power-outages-notifications/) on where the data is coming from.

## TODO

- [ ] Use geocode.xyz to properly match areas of interest (and store it in `outages-postprocessed.json`)
- [ ] Differentiate between current and future outages
- [ ] Create a map reading data from `outages.json`?
